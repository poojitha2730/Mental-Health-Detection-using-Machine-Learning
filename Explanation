Depression is a serious concern among today's youngsters.  Our project focuses on the individual's mental health, allowing us to identify the underlying causes of sadness or anxiety. The goa
l of our project is to forecast state the mental wellbeing of the individual. We have used many approaches for machine learning like a Random Forest Classifier, Bagging, Texting, Stacking, and Logical Regressions. Data was acquired through a survey that we performed by asking participants to fill out a Google form with a variety of questions. To improve accuracy of model, we have label-encoded the data which we have gathered. The data is subjected to a variety of algorithms using machine learning for getting labels. After that, a model for prediction an individual's psychological condition will be built.
